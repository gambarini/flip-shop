### Cart

Describes the Cart by managing Items Purchased and the total price of items.

until removed from a Cart.

### Promotion

Describes the Promotions affecting a Cart, depending on the Items present in the Cart.

#### Available promotions (examples)
- Buy MacBook Pro (43N23P), get a Raspberry Pi B (234234) for free per MacBook purchased.
  - Implemented via FreeItemPromotion; cart will include Raspberry Pi items with a discount equal to their price.
- Buy 3 Google Home (120P90), get 1 free (every third unit is free).
  - Implemented via ItemQtyPriceFreePromotion; discount equals one Google Home price per 3 units.
- Buy more than 3 Alexa Speakers (A304SD), get 10% off on those speakers.
  - Implemented via ItemQtyPriceDiscountPercentagePromotion; applies when qty > 3 (not >=).

#### Cart update from applied promotions

Promotions can change a Cart by:

- Adding an Item quantity to a Cart (e.g., free Raspberry Pi).
- Adding a discount to an Item purchased.

## Considerations

### Project organization

- ```/utils```: external utilities
- ```/internal/model```: domain models
- ```/internal/repo```: repositories
- ```/internal/route```: HTTP handlers, and domain service logic (** handlers and service logic could be separated ideally **)

### Memory key/value database

- The application uses a basic memory Key/Value database, in ```/utils/memdb```
- It implements an ACID isolation level of "Serializable" by mutex locking the map stored in memory
- It ** does not implement transaction rollback ** for the sake of demo simplicity (no time for this now)

### Unit tests

- Domain models, repositories, and HTTP handlers have tests.
- Run all tests: go test ./...
- With race: go test -race ./...
- Coverage HTML: go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -html=coverage.out
